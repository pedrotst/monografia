 With the growing interest in machine learning, good frameworks and state of the art implementation are a need in modern world. For such we need to deal with Bayesian probability, wich is able to deal with our belief of the world, somthing that the usual probability (i.e. physical probability) is not able of doing. With this in mind we provide a study in the of \gls{bn}, since \glspl{bn} provide a great model to deal with causal relations and bayesian probability. For such we shall use UnBBayes framework and implement plugins for it.
